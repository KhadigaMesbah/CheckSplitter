# CheckSplitter

A Dilemma; you go out with a group of friends, you have fun and order good food. All is good till the hardest part hits you, Check Splitting!
Someone will usually need to take control of divvying up the check, taking out a calculator or
begin writing a lot to add up everyone’s individual order. Sometimes people do the
addition themselves and forget to consider tax and tip and end up underpaying. Some
people complain that tax and tip shouldn’t be split evenly if they didn’t order as much as
another person. Almost all the time.
The goal of this application is to resolve this issue, making check splitting a simple task for everyone.

This application is implemented using OpenCV, Tesseract, and Android.
